# Chrome new tab extension ([Winky Widgets](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/winky-widgets/mfgcpbcdabageodfebcphkcidhfgcghl))


## Introduction:
In this series we're going to see how to create a Chrome extension with React. 

We're going to build 6 React apps and combine them into one single interface to form a Chrome extension that gets opened on every new tab. 

This project features 6 widgets (Time and date component, Greeting component, Weather app, Crypto rates app, Todos app and a Bookmarker app).

We'll cover a bunch of modern JavaScript concepts by consuming 3 free external APIs and saving data to the browser's localStorage.

The extension is available on the Chrome Web Store:
