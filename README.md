# Chrome new tab extension ([Winky Widgets](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/winky-widgets/mfgcpbcdabageodfebcphkcidhfgcghl))


## Introduction:
In this series we're going to see how to create a Chrome extension with React. 

We're going to build **6 React apps** and combine them into one single interface to form a Chrome extension that gets opened on every new tab. 

This project features 6 widgets (**Time and date component, Greeting component, Weather app, Crypto rates app, Todos app and a Bookmarker app**).

We'll cover a bunch of modern JavaScript concepts by consuming 3 free external APIs and saving data to the browser's localStorage.

The [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/winky-widgets/mfgcpbcdabageodfebcphkcidhfgcghl) is available on the Chrome Web Store.
